I can save my videos and photos on here and then delete them from my phone saved in my photo app that way I can have more storage on my phone to update apps and install apps and such!! It has a 2gb limit...which is fine..cause I can use multiple emails. So far I haven't experienced any issues..thankfully. I can go back and visit my vids...I'm hoping it doesn't like not play or erase or something..since I do delete the vids from my samsung photo app.\n",
